1. Understanding Computational Thinking
- Breaking down problems into smaller parts (Decomposition)
- Finding patterns (Pattern Recognition)
- Focusing on important details while ignoring irrelevant ones (Abstraction)
- Creating step-by-step solutions (Algorithm Design)

2. Today's Learning Points:
- Learned how to approach problems systematically
- Practiced breaking complex problems into manageable pieces
- Identified patterns in problem-solving scenarios
- Developed logical thinking skills

3. Applications:
- Used decomposition to organize project tasks
- Applied pattern recognition in data analysis
- Created algorithms for solving everyday problems

4. Reflections:
- What worked well:
- Challenges faced:
- Areas for improvement:

Next Steps:
- Continue practicing problem-solving techniques
- Apply computational thinking to new challenges
- Review and refine current solutions
